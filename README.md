# Web Audio API v2.0 Spec


This repository contains the latest editor's draft of the [W3C AudioWG](https://www.w3.org/2011/audio/)'s Web Audio API v2.0.

At this stage, there is no initial draft. The first drafts will include only the new features. 
However, Web Audio API 2.0 builds on, so will include, all of Web Audio API 1.0.

# Tests

For normative changes, a corresponding
[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,
both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should
not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why
and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow
up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.

# v1.0
